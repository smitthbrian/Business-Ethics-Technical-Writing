Course: ENG 3100: Business Writing -- Walker College of Business

This report presents an in-depth analysis of the ethical challenges that led to Travis Kalanick’s resignation as CEO of Uber in 2017. Through a critical examination of key issues such as regulatory evasion, workplace harassment, and a data breach cover-up, I highlight the vital importance of ethical leadership and corporate credibility in business.

In crafting this report, I employed technical writing skills to synthesize complex information and present a narrative that underscores the implications of neglecting ethical standards. My focus was on demonstrating clarity and precision in analyzing the impact of Kalanick's leadership style on Uber's corporate culture and reputation.

This project not only showcases my ability to engage in rigorous research and analysis but also reflects my proficiency in communicating essential business concepts in a clear and structured manner. By addressing the consequences of unethical practices, I emphasize the need for transparency and integrity in corporate governance. This report exemplifies my technical writing capabilities, as I aim to convey critical insights effectively to a professional audience.
